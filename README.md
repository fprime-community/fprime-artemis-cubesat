# F' Deployment for the Artemis Cubesat Kit

This repository contains the flight software for the Artemis CubeSat, a cost-effective, spaceflight-ready 1U CubeSat designed to expand accessibility to space and aerospace engineering education.

For more detailed information about the Artemis CubeSat, please visit our [website](https://sites.google.com/mahinaaerospace.com/home).

# Starting Requirements

Before attempting to install F', please ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

1. Operating System: Linux or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
2. Git
3. CMake 3.16 or newer (command-line tool must be accessible from the system path)
4. CLang or GNU C and C++ compilers (e.g., gcc and g++)
5. Python 3.8+ with virtual environments and PIP installed
6. Curl
7. Nano (or your choice of command line text editor)

Once you have these requirements in place, you can proceed with the project instructions.

# Installing F'

Before proceeding with the instructions, make sure to install F' by running the following command:

```shell
pip install -U fprime-tools
```

# Project Requirements

## Installing arduino-cli

To get started, you'll need to download and install arduino-cli:
```shell
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin ; curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arduino/arduino-cli/master/install.sh | BINDIR=~/.local/bin sh
```

## Adding `~/.local/bin` to your PATH

To make arduino-cli easily accessible from your terminal, add ~/.local/bin to your PATH. This command will first append the line `export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH` to the .bashrc file and then immediately source the .bashrc file to apply the changes:

```shell
echo 'export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

## Installing Arduino-CLI Wrapper

Next, you'll need to install the arduino-cli-cmake-wrapper:
```shell
pip install arduino-cli-cmake-wrapper
```

## Setting Up Arduino-CLI for Your Arduino Boards

Now, configure Arduino-CLI for the Artemis CubeSats arduino board:

Initialize the arduino-cli configuration file:
```shell
arduino-cli config init
```

For Teensy boards, add the board manager URL:
```shell
arduino-cli config add board_manager.additional_urls https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/package_teensy_index.json
```

Install the new board packages:
```shell
arduino-cli core update-index
arduino-cli core install teensy:avr
```

## Adding udev rules (Linux Only)
If you're using Linux, you'll need to add udev rules for the Teensy. This command will download the `.rules` files from [here](https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-baremetal-reference/tree/main/docs/rules/00-teensy.rules) and save them into `/etc/udev/rules.d/`.

```shell
mkdir -p /etc/udev/ && curl -o /etc/udev/rules.d -L https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-baremetal-reference/raw/main/docs/rules/00-teensy.rules
```

## Raspberry Pi Tooolchian 

For the Raspberry Pi deployment, you'll need to set up the cross-compiler toolchain. To do so download the [Raspberry Pi Zero cross-compiler toolchain](https://sourceforge.net/projects/raspberry-pi-cross-compilers/files/Raspberry%20Pi%20GCC%20Cross-Compiler%20Toolchains/Bullseye/GCC%2010.3.0/Raspberry%20Pi%201%2C%20Zero/cross-gcc-10.3.0-pi_0-1.tar.gz/download):

```shell
curl -LJO https://sourceforge.net/projects/raspberry-pi-cross-compilers/files/Raspberry%20Pi%20GCC%20Cross-Compiler%20Toolchains/Bullseye/GCC%2010.3.0/Raspberry%20Pi%201%2C%20Zero/cross-gcc-10.3.0-pi_0-1.tar.gz
```

Extract the `.tar.gz` into `/opt/`:

```shell
tar -xzvf cross-gcc-10.3.0-pi_0-1.tar.gz -C /opt/
```
Then, set the RPI_TOOLCHAIN_DIR environment variable:
```shell
export RPI_TOOLCHAIN_DIR=/opt/cross-pi-gcc-10.3.0-0/
```
Note:
  - You'll need to run this command every time you open a new terminal.

# Using the F' - Artemis CubeSat Deployment

Download the project into a directory of your choice:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-artemis-cubesat.git
```

Change directories to the project:
```sh
cd fprime-artemis-cubesat
```

This project uses submodules, so navigate to where you cloned the project and run:
```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
Install the required F' tools version: 
```shell
pip install -r fprime/requirements.txt
```
Finally, install the artemis-cubesat Arduino Library:

```shell
arduino-cli lib install artemis-cubesat
```

## Building the Project

To set up and build the project, follow these steps:

```bash
# In fprime-artemis-cubesat
fprime-util generate
fprime-util build
```
> `fprime-util build` has two available arguments 'teensy41' and 'raspberrypi' 

> `fprime-util generate` sets up the build environment for a project/deployment. It only needs to be done once and also accepts 'teensy41' and 'raspberrypi' arguments.

## Combine RPi and Teensy Dictionaries

Run this script to combine RPi and Teensy dictionaries:

```shell
cp docs/scripts/combine_dictionaries ~/.local/bin
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/combine_dictionaries
```

```shell
combine_dictionaries build-artifacts/teensy41/TeensyFSW/dict/TeensyFSWTopologyAppDictionary.xml build-artifacts/raspberrypi/RpiFSW/dict/RpiFSWTopologyAppDictionary.xml dictionary.xml
```

Note:
  - You only need to run this script once. 

# Programming and Running on Hardware

## Uploading hex file for the Teensy
After running fprime-util build teensy41, open up the Teensyduino application. Choose the hex file located in ./build-artifacts/teensy41/TeensyFSW/bin/ to load into Teensyduino. Manually press the reset button on the Teensy to upload the program.

## Using GDS over serial

To use GDS over serial, run the following command:
```sh
fprime-gds -n --dictionary dictionary.xml --comm-adapter uart --uart-device /dev/ttyACM0 --uart-baud 115200
```
Note:
  - If you have more than one device connected, or if you are using a different OS, `/dev/ttyACM0` may differ for your system.
